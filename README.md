## üîß Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Create a Conda environment
Note: Anaconda installation required
```bash
conda create -n medibot python=3.10 -y
conda activate medibot
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment
You will need an OpenAI API key (payment required) and Pinecone API Key (free). Create a .env file in the root with the following:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
```

### 6. üß† Generate Vector Index
Run the script to load and index the documents into Pinecone:
```python
python store_index.py
```
Note: **This will take several minutes** You only need to run this once during installation, **or** if you modify the reference Data.

### 7. Run the Flask app
```bash
flask run
```
If the app doesn't start automatically, paste http://localhost:5000/ into your browser.
